I learned and researched about neural networks using the videos by 3Blue1Brown
I read articles such as this one (https://www.ibm.com/topics/neural-networks) to make sure I fully understand how NN's work
Summary: used the previous sources along with this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bte8Er0QhDg) to help me make this network
I learned about activation functinons and their different types
I learned about the nodes in the network and how they are similar to neurons in the human brain
I learned about epochs and how fast/slow to make the learning process for the network.
I learned about layers and how deep neural networks refer to the large amounts of layers.
In this network only a few layers are needed, an input layers of the image size, hidden layers to determine which digit the image is, outout layer to decide/predict.
