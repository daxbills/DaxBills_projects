This purpose of this project is to create a chess engine capable at playing a high skill level using python.
This project based its code from the psuedo code from the chess programming wiki https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page
The implementation of the algorithms and debugging was all done by me.
I used an API from Lichess.org to upload my engine to their website to play against other players and AI's
